      <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: <time datetime="2025-10-04">October 4, 2025</time></p>

      <p>These terms and conditions apply to the <strong>Quiz Tempo</strong> app (hereby referred to as the “Application”) for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Akmal Ahmed</strong> (hereby referred to as the “Service Provider”) as an <strong>Ad Supported</strong> service.</p>

      <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these terms. Do not copy or modify the Application, any part of it, or our trademarks. You may not attempt to extract the source code, translate the Application, or create derivative versions. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>

      <p>The Service Provider aims to keep the Application useful and efficient and may modify the Application or charge for services at any time. Any charges will be clearly communicated.</p>

      <h2>Data & processing</h2>
      <p>The Application stores and processes personal data you provide to deliver the Service. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and access to the Application. Jailbreaking or rooting your device may compromise security and prevent the Application from functioning correctly.</p>

      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>The Application uses third-party services that have their own Terms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/admob/terms" rel="noopener">AdMob</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" rel="noopener">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Connectivity & charges</h2>
      <p>Some features require an active internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data). The Service Provider is not responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of connectivity or exhausted data allowances. If you use the Application outside a Wi-Fi area, your mobile provider’s terms still apply and you may incur data charges, including roaming charges. If you are not the bill payer, you confirm that you have permission to use the device and data plan.</p>

      <h2>Device responsibility</h2>
      <p>You are responsible for keeping your device charged. The Service Provider is not liable if you cannot access the Service due to device power loss.</p>

      <h2>Liability</h2>
      <p>While the Service Provider strives to keep the Application updated and accurate, information may rely on third parties. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, resulting from reliance on the Application’s functionality or information.</p>

      <h2>Updates & termination</h2>
      <p>The Application may be updated from time to time. You agree to accept updates when offered to continue using the Application. The Service Provider may cease providing the Application and may terminate its use at any time without notice. Upon termination, rights and licenses granted to you will end, and you must cease use and, if necessary, delete the Application.</p>

      <h2>Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>The Service Provider may update these Terms periodically. Please review this page regularly for changes. Updates will be posted here.</p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions or suggestions about these Terms, contact the Service Provider at <a href="mailto:help.aks.system@gmail.com">help.aks.system@gmail.com</a>.</p>
